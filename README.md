# Machine Learning for EEG Dataset Generalization

This repository is in progress.  The goal is to develop an error-related potential (ErrP) processing pipeline that allows for generalization across subjects and sessions.  Various feature selection, feature extraction, and classification methods have been evaluated in order to determine an optimal pipeline that extracts invariant features for classification.  This research is being conducted in conjunction with the Chair for Cognitive Systems and is a precursor to the trust in autonomous driving study.
